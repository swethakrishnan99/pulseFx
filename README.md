# PulseFX client portal: front-end demo

A non-functional front-end demo of a single, branded PulseFX client portal that combines the best parts of the
vendor portals (Ebury, Monex). All data is demo data. Nothing is sent, saved or connected to a real backend.

Built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Run it
    npm install
    npm run dev        # then open the address it prints (usually http://localhost:5173)

Requires Node 20.19+ (or 22.12+).

## Screens
- Dashboard: Quick Quote, USD/CAD rate trend, holding accounts and balances, payments and trades in progress, help tooltips
- Move Money: one page with a toggle between sending a payment and converting between your own accounts; fund from a holding account or by direct debit from a verified linked bank account
- Beneficiaries: masked account numbers, search, add and edit beneficiary form, CSV export
- Accounts: holding accounts (flags and balances, details side panel, certificate download demo) and a Linked bank accounts tab (new accounts show as Pending until PulseFX verifies them)
- Forwards: list of forward contracts with optional columns, and a two-step Drawdown form funded from a holding account
- Trade Finance: supplier payment finance with credit line, submitted requests, repayments, early-repayment calculator and a New request form
- Reports: payment tracker (progress by step) and payment history with CSV export (the CSV download works)
- Help & support, Profile and Security settings

## Things to know
- Exchange rate: fetched from Frankfurter (European Central Bank reference rates). These update once a day, so this is
  the latest official market rate, not a live price. If the service can't be reached the demo shows a labelled sample rate.
  A real build would use the vendor's quote API. Only `src/lib/fx.js` needs to change.
- Logo and colours are placeholders (a recreated pulse-line mark and a placeholder palette in `src/index.css`) until PulseFX's
  official brand assets are applied.
- Navigation uses simple in-page state, not a router.
- Forwards, Trade Finance, deposit rules, holidays, fees (about 1.5%) and the minimum finance amount are invented sample values pending confirmation with PulseFX.
- All state (new beneficiaries, linked accounts, drawdowns, finance requests) is kept in memory and resets when the page reloads.
- Sign-in accepts any well-formed email and any password: there is no real authentication.
